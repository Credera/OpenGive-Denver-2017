## What is OpenLearn?

OpenLearn is a web-based curriculum management platform envisioned by three Denver, CO-based education nonprofits. Each organization provides STEM and/or digital literacy education to K-12 students in underserved, high-needs communities. OpenLearn is meant to serve as a student progress tracking tool for these nonprofits (and other education organizations) to manage their curriculums, measure curriculum effectiveness, and identify students in need of greater support. Organizations will be able to host courses (including assignments, milestones, and grades) for their respective curriculums in OpenLearn and engage with students directly through the site. In turn, students and their families will have digital access to these curriculums and be able to easily monitor student progress. The vision for OpenLearn is to collaboratively develop a product that will enable education nonprofits to better empower underserved youth in STEM fields.
