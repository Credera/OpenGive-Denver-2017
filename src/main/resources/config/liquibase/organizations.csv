For a student growing up in a home without Internet or a computer, the doors to limitless possibilities are closed. KidsTek breaks those doors down with hands-on technology education for Colorado's underserved youth."2,OWL,"OWL's holistic, technology-focused programming decreases the achievement gap and addresses the need for more STEM education and access to technology in the Denver metro area, where many of OWL's students have limited access to computers at school or at home. Compared to their non-OWL peers, OWL students on average receive 600% more computer lab time, show improved attendance and higher standardized test scores than their non-OWL peers. As students progress through OWL, earning a laptop, parents develop a positive relationship to their children's schools and education, wanting their children to attend college."3,CABPES,"The Colorado Association of Black Professional Engineers and Scientists (CABPES) is a non-profit organization dedicated to encouraging African-Americans and other underrepresented youth to pursue science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers.  By doing so,  the number of minority STEM professionals will increase to the level that better represents the minority population, while assisting industry in meeting the growing demand for STEM professionals.
